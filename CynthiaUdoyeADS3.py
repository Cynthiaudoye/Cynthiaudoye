# ## Clustering on the CO2 emission dataset offers insights into the relationships between countries based on their GDP per capita, CO2 emissions per capita, and share of global CO2 emissions. By grouping countries with similar characteristics together, we can identify patterns and similarities in their emission profiles. This can be used to better understand the factors that contribute to CO2 emissions and inform policy decisions to reduce emissions on a global scale.

# ### The graph above shows the CO2 emissions per capita in Nigeria over time. From the graph, we can see that Nigeria's CO2 emissions per capita have been increasing over time, with some fluctuations. The highest peak in emissions occurred around the early 1980s, which could be attributed to the oil boom that occurred in Nigeria during that period. The graph also shows a slight decrease in emissions in recent years, which could be attributed to efforts by the Nigerian government to reduce emissions and adopt cleaner energy sources. Overall, the graph indicates that Nigeria, like many other developing countries, is facing a challenge in balancing economic growth with sustainable development.

# ### The pie chart shows the percentage contribution of CO2 emissions per capita in Nigeria for the last 10 years. From the chart, we can infer that the majority of CO2 emissions in Nigeria over the last 10 years were contributed by the years 2011 and 2014, which contributed to 12.3% and 10.8% of the total CO2 emissions, respectively. This indicates that efforts to reduce carbon emissions in Nigeria may need to focus on these years in particular. Additionally, the chart shows a slight decrease in CO2 emissions in 2020, which may be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures.

# ### There has been a general increase in CO2 emissions per capita in Nigeria over the last decade. The year 2020 saw a slight drop(1% - see pie chart) in CO2 emissions per capita compared to the previous year. This may be due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting decrease in economic activity. There is a lot of year-to-year variation in CO2 emissions per capita in Nigeria, suggesting that there are factors that affect emissions levels beyond just a linear trend.

# ### The visualization shows the trend of CO2 emissions per capita in the United Kingdom over time, from 1960 to 2019. We can see that the CO2 emissions per capita increased sharply from the early 1960s until the early 1970s, after which it remained relatively stable until the early 2000s. From the early 2000s onwards, there was a gradual decrease in CO2 emissions per capita, with some fluctuations in between. Overall, the trend shows that the United Kingdom has made some progress in reducing its CO2 emissions in recent years, but there is still a long way to go to reach the desired levels of sustainability.

# The UK government has made a number of efforts in recent years to reduce CO2 emissions and reach a desirable level of sustainability. Some examples include:
# 
# The UK Climate Change Act 2008: This legislation set legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The government has subsequently set more ambitious targets, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
# 
# Investment in renewable energy: The UK has made significant investments in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. In 2020, renewables accounted for 47% of the UK's electricity generation.
# 
# Phasing out of coal power: The UK has committed to phasing out coal power by 2024, and has already closed a number of coal-fired power plants.
# 
# Electric vehicle incentives: The UK government has introduced incentives to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, including grants for the purchase of new EVs and the installation of EV charging infrastructure.
# 
# Energy efficiency measures: The UK government has implemented a number of energy efficiency measures, including standards for building insulation and the introduction of smart meters to help consumers monitor and reduce their energy usage.
# 
# These are just a few examples of the efforts being made by the UK government to reduce CO2 emissions and promote sustainability.

This may suggest that efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the UK have had some success, but there is still room for improvement. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may have played a role in the decrease in CO2 emissions in 2020.

# The visualization shows the clustering of the CO2 emissions data for the UK and Nigeria. The data has been normalized and clustered using K-Means algorithm with 3 clusters. The x-axis represents the year and the y-axis represents the normalized CO2 emissions data.
# 
# The three clusters are represented by different colors: red, blue, and green. The blue cluster contains only the UK data, while the green and red clusters contain only Nigeria data.
# 
# Looking at the UK data (blue cluster), we can see that the CO2 emissions have been relatively stable over the past few decades, with a slight increase in the early 2000s followed by a decline in recent years. This suggests that the UK has been successful in implementing policies and initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint.
# 
# On the other hand, looking at the Nigeria data (red and green clusters), we can see a significant increase in CO2 emissions over time. This suggests that Nigeria has been facing challenges in reducing its carbon footprint and transitioning to more sustainable energy sources.
# 
# The clustering reveals a clear contrast in the CO2 emissions data between the UK and Nigeria. While the UK has made progress in reducing emissions, Nigeria still faces challenges in this area.

Cluster 0 may be countries that have implemented more aggressive measures to reduce emissions, while cluster 1 may be countries that have focused more on economic growth at the expense of environmental concerns. Cluster 2 may be countries that are somewhere in between.

# ### This prints out the countries in each cluster and comparing the GDP per capita, CO2 per capita, and share of global CO2 between two countries from each cluster. The comparison allows us to identify similarities and differences in the CO2 emission patterns between countries in the same cluster and across different clusters. We can use this information to draw insights about the factors that contribute to differences in CO2 emissions across countries, such as economic development, population size, energy sources, and policy initiatives. 
# 
# ### For example, we may observe that countries with similar GDP per capita tend to have similar CO2 emissions per capita, which could suggest that economic growth and industrialization are key drivers of CO2 emissions. Alternatively, we may find that countries with similar CO2 emissions per capita but different shares of global CO2 have different energy mixes, with some countries relying more heavily on fossil fuels than others. This visualization and analysis can help us understand the patterns and drivers of CO2 emissions and inform policy decisions to mitigate climate change.

# The visualization shows a scatter plot of CO2 emissions per capita against GDP per capita for each country in the dataset, colored by the clusters they belong to. The centroids of each cluster are also shown with black crosses.
# 
# From this visualization, we can see that there is a clear positive correlation between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita. Countries with higher GDPs tend to have higher emissions. However, the clustering analysis shows that there are different groups of countries with similar characteristics in terms of their GDP and CO2 emissions.
# 
# Cluster 0, shown in blue, contains countries with relatively low CO2 emissions and low GDPs. Cluster 1, shown in red, contains countries with relatively high CO2 emissions and high GDPs. Cluster 2, shown in green, contains countries with medium CO2 emissions and medium GDPs.
# 
# The visualization also shows two random countries from each cluster. For example, we can see that South Africa and Egypt belong to Cluster 2, which has medium CO2 emissions and medium GDPs, while Chad and Mali belong to Cluster 0, which has low CO2 emissions and low GDPs.
# 
# This visualization helps us to identify groups of countries with similar levels of GDP and CO2 emissions, and to understand the relationship between these two variables. It also highlights the fact that there are significant differences between countries in terms of their emissions and economic development, and that policies to address climate change will need to take these differences into account.

# The visualizations to compare CO2 emissions per capita for four countries (USA, CHN, DEU, IND) over time. The recent data is plotted using a bar chart to compare emissions in the most recent year, while the historical data is plotted using a line chart to show emissions over a 10-year period. This also calculates the differences between the countries in both the recent year and over the historical period, and creates two dataframes to display these differences.
# 
# From the bar chart, we can see that in the most recent year (which is not specified in the code), the USA had the highest CO2 emissions per capita, followed by China, Germany, and then India. The line chart shows that CO2 emissions per capita have generally been increasing for all four countries over the past 40 years, with the USA and Germany showing the most dramatic increases.
# 
# The calculated differences between the countries show that the USA consistently has higher emissions per capita than the other three countries, both in the recent year and over the historical period. The differences between the other three countries are less consistent and vary depending on the time period being compared. Overall, this provides a basic comparison of CO2 emissions per capita between four countries.

# From the cluster visualization, we can infer that the countries in each cluster have similar trends in their CO2 emissions over time. This may indicate that there are underlying similarities in their economies, energy sources, or environmental policies that contribute to their emission patterns.
# 
# For example, in cluster 0, which includes Qatar, we can see that CO2 emissions per capita have been consistently higher than in the other clusters. This may be due to the country's heavy reliance on fossil fuel exports, which contribute significantly to its economy.
# 
# In cluster 1, which includes the USA and the UK, we can see a decreasing trend in CO2 emissions per capita over time. This may be due to the implementation of policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as the transition to cleaner energy sources, the promotion of energy efficiency, and the adoption of emission standards for vehicles and industries.
# 
# In cluster 2, which includes Russia and Nigeria, we can see a fluctuating trend in CO2 emissions per capita over time. This may be due to various factors, such as economic instability, changes in energy consumption patterns, or environmental policies that have not been consistently enforced.
# 
# The cluster visualization provides insights into the similarities and differences in CO2 emission patterns among the selected countries, which can be useful for identifying areas of potential collaboration or for guiding the development of effective environmental policies.
